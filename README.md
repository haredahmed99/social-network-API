# NoSQL_Social_Network_API

**What does this application do and why?**

* As a developer working on a social network, I want a working back end social networking website that uses a flexible database (MongoDB)
* This back end app has all necessary models and routes to connect to a functioning front-end: 
    - Ability to create, update, and delete a user
    - Ability to add and remove a friend to a user
    - Ability to create, update, and delete a thought associated with a user
    - Ability to create and delete reactions to other's thoughts
* Using mongo and mongoose, this app has the ability to create and manipulate a flexible database and access information using each route

**How the application is organized**
The NoSQL Social Network is organized in the following files:
